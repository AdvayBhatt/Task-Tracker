I will need to know:

argparse or sys.argv                    For reading command-line inputs
File handling (open, read, write) 	To work with JSON files
JSON (json module)	                Reading and writing task data
Date/time (datetime)	                Timestamps for tasks
Functions & maybe classes        	To keep code clean and organized
